// INSTRUCTIONS:
//trim QUERY
//explode by comma separated values
//array_sum exploded values

// QUESTION
//How much will the summed value be? 

//ANSWER
//array_sum will only add numbers, numbers as strings, and bollean values. Therefor, the sum would be the single, numeric query value (which I think was 12).
